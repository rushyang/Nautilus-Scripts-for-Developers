This github repository contains some of very useful nautilus scripts. They often save plenty of time, executing by mere 2 clicks!

1) How to install? 
~ Copy your prefered script to ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts.
~ Open 'gnome-terminal', locate to above path, execute `chmod 755 *` (without back-quote).
~ Open a nautilus window, right click > scripts > 'Your copied script should appear here'.
~ If you are not getting scripts menu in context menu, open 'gnome-terminal' and execute `nautilus -q` (without back-quote).

2) Any Prerequisites?
~ Well, yeah! some...
~ To integrate these scripts with GTK+ dialogs I have used program called "zenity". Because it's not preinstalled in any linux distro, Install it with "sudo apt-get install zenity" in Ubuntu. "yum install zenity" (Fedora). If you're using any other distro, you'll have to google. But I reckon it shouldn't be tough.
~ In addition, I have used 'notify-send' to notify the user with OSD. You can install this library - 'libnotify-bin' with "sudo apt-get install libnotify-bin" in Ubuntu. "yum install libnotify-bin" (Fedora).
~ If you're using "Compile Java File(s)" script, for obvious reason you need JDK installed in your machine.
~ In copy file location script (both), I have used xclip to integrate terminal with clipboard. Install it with "sudo apt-get install xclip"
~ To use "Install this APK" script, I have used adb (Android Debug Bridge) from Android SDK. You can get it from Android Developers community and import the path in script before using it.

You can report any bugs/problems related to my scripts to "rushyangdarji@gmail.com"
